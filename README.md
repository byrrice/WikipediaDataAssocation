# WikipediaWordAssocation
This program was inspired by a Google Challenge where they made you associate words in a word web and each associated word would open the web further out. To make this challenge easier, we can implement a function in javascript that will scrape the wikipedia website of choice and decide by the length of the word what you are looking for. This will scrape the Page for hyperlinks in paragraphs and return to you the list of words.


This was also created to do some HTML/JS outside of my website.

## How to Run
1. Download nodejs
2. go to folder with file
3. node app.js 'link' lengthofdesiredstring (put quotes around if using parenthese) 
EX: node app.js 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Blake_(tennis)' 8

## To Do:
I need to convert this to a working web app by building a website with html and having my js script be able to pass in data to the html site.
